I attempted this assignment knowing full well that I have no clue of what I am doing. I vaguely knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to call the RESTCountries API and get Countries Names and Populatino Sizes and store the data in an Array. I was able, using the API code you gave us in class, to get the RESTCountries API to work and to output the data I needed. But I had problems wrapping my brain around creating the Array and Sorting the data. There was so much to look at in the terminal and so many issues. Many countries has been relaced with question marks, many were outputed multiple times, and so on. the request for getting the Countries names was not just returning the countries names, but also common names, names in other languages, more data than I wanted or needed. 

I did use AI to pretty much write the entire code, minus the code you supplied. But I created a new file and retyped all the code so I can truely understand what was happening. I found that this strategy helps me the most in understanding the code.

Features:

* Calls the REST Countries API and requests data on Country Name and Population.
* In two Arrays, Names and Populations are stored.
* The Names Array is the sorted aphlabetically and the Populations Array is sorted to match the correct 
  Population with the correct Country.
* Then the Arrays are outputted to the terminal to show all the Countries and their respected Populations.

This assignment has been a pain for me and I didn't have enough time to really get into it and actually fight to get it all working. I do not believe I satisfied the criteria for this assignment. But I'll except whatever grade is handed to me.
